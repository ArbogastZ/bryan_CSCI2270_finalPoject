Text based game 

Instructions!
1. As long as you use the VM from cu boulder there should be no issue
2. all the files are in the FinalProjectVM folder
3. make sure the txt file is in

This is a text based dungeon crawler. You go from dungeon to dungeon to defeat monster.
Everything is randomized(mostly) like your stats and number of monsters. etc....
Later i might put in txt files with monster into ... armor.. weapons. but that would take longer and I is sleepy.

sorry for lack of comments. I is tired!

have fun!
find bugs!

bugs like if you beat the game.... nothing should happen.
also if you deal negative damage it heals the enemy. Same thign can happen to you.
this is not a glitch. it was just too funny to take out.
