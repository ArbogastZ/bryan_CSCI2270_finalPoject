Text based game 
plans for project date(graphs, linked lists, vectors)
1.4 randomized theme dungeons(earth, wind, fire, water)
2.each dungeon has random floors stored in a linked list. (the amount of rooms per dungeons will be random 2-4 rooms then a boss room)
3.will make a few monsters to fight using a class which will be used the same as a player. 
4.reading in plenty of text files.

strech goals
1.use weighted graph and a time system (example: doing x takes y time)
2. allow different monsters at different times.
